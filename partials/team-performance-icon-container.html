<!--
  Team Performance Dashboard Button partial (canonicalized)

  Rules:
  - Use `data-team-icon` attribute to hold a CDN URL or data URI inserted server-side.
  - Do NOT embed base64-encoded images inline in the markup or within style attributes.
  - Keep a fallback <img> that uses the same server-side value so non-CSS renderers show the icon.
  - This file should contain a single canonical block; no duplicates.
-->

<!-- Inspected and removed: duplicate insights-menu-card block -->



<!-- Notes:
  - Use `data-team-icon` attribute to hold a CDN or data URI at render-time; avoid inline styles or base64 in markup to preserve CSS parsing and linter rules.
  - Keep the fallback <img> for non-CSS rendering environments.
  - If other partials or backups still contain inline base64, consider archiving them outside of the repo or replacing them with assets under /assets.
-->


<!-- Inspected and removed: duplicate insights-menu-card block (with <img> fallback) -->

<!-- Notes:
  - This partial uses the `data-team-icon` attribute to allow server-side injection of CDN or data URI values, while avoiding inline style background-image tokens that break CSS parsing/linting.
  - The fallback <img> keeps rendering safe for non-CSS or at-risks clients.
  - All previous duplicate blocks and inlined base64 images were removed.
