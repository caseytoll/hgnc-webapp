- Lineups entered manually from paper
- Score entry via multiple form fields
- Basic stats available but no context
- No AI coaching insights
- Must remember game details between sessions
- Manual notes for each quarter
- One login token per device/team (frustrating to switch teams)

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ AI-powered summaries of games
- ❌ Opposition analysis before game
- ❌ Automatic lineup suggestions
- ❌ Real-time performance insights

  - Admin (head coach)

**Why Not 100?**
- PIN system still in place (added to coach identity, not removed)
- No SSO/integrations with external identity systems (email-based)
- No API-level auth for integrations (fixture updates via service account)

**User Impact:** Multi-coach teams now fully supported, audit trail complete, security hardened

---

### 8. System Reliability (60 → 91)

**Current State (60/100):**

- Error recovery: Manual (coach must reload if something fails)
- Retry logic: Basic (depends on user refresh)
- Logging: Partial (Diagnostics sheet has some gaps)
- Monitoring: None (no alerts if something breaks)
- Failure modes: Visible (user sees error message, confusion)

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Automatic retry on transient failures
- ❌ Comprehensive error logging
- ❌ Monitoring + alerting
- ❌ Graceful degradation (app works even if AI is down)
- ❌ Rollback strategy (bad deployment can be reverted)

**Fully Implemented State (91/100):**
- Uptime: **99.2%** (Google Sheets + queued processing + fallbacks)
- Error recovery: **Automatic** (failed AI jobs retry 3 times over 20 min)
- Retry logic: **Smart** (transient vs permanent failures, max deadline)
- Logging: **Comprehensive** (every operation logged to Diagnostics sheet)
- Monitoring: **Dashboard** (AI health metrics, queue size, success rate)
- Monitoring alerts: **Thresholds** (queue fails > 10 times/week? Alert coach)
- Graceful degradation: ✅ App works without AI (queue jobs skip, fallback to manual)
- Fallback modes: ✅ If Gemini API down, app continues (no AI but functional)
- Rollback strategy: **One-command** (revert to previous deployment)
- Health checks: **Active** (proactive checks every 10 min)

**Why Not 100?**
- Google Sheets API occasional rate limits (rare)
- Gemini API quota exhaustion (handled gracefully, not ideal)
- Some edge cases in PropertiesService atomicity (very rare)

**User Impact:** App goes from "occasionally broken" to "always up, fails gracefully, monitors itself"

---

- Concurrent users: **50+ simultaneous** (Sheets API has quota buffer)
- API calls per day: **50,000+** (Squadi, GameDay, Gemini, all scaled)
- Queue jobs: **1000+ queued** (processAIQueue handles bulk)
- Batch processing: **Parallel opposition scouting** (Sunday 10 AM processes 100+ teams simultaneous)

**Why Not 100?**
- Google Sheets API has rate limits (hit at ~100 teams modifying simultaneously)
- Gemini API quota (budget per team, not per app)
- PropertiesService size limits (11 MB per key, need cleanup strategy)

**User Impact:** Platform scales from "pilot app" to "multi-league infrastructure"

  - ✅ AI suggested Starting 7 (opposition-aware)
  - ✅ Position-specific recommendations (who plays GS? GA? WA?)
  - ✅ Favorite position analysis (player prefers WA, data confirms 83% their best position)
  - ✅ Load balance incentives (Sarah overplayed, recommend Chloe)
  - ✅ Opposition matchup (opponent's strong defence, recommend GS change)
- **Substitution Decisions:**
  - ✅ Rolling subs auto-balanced (fairness enforced)
  - ✅ Performance indicators (goal ratios per position per quarter)
  - ✅ Defensive response (opponent scoring from Q3 onwards? Change D)
  - ✅ Fatigue tracking (how many quarters has Sarah played?)
  - ✅ Comeback suggestions (if behind at Q3, recommended lineup for Q4)
- **Training Decisions:**
  - ✅ Issue correlation (stepping in Q1 + Q3? Training notes suggest drills needed)
  - ✅ Attendance impact (players who missed session X got worse at Y)
  - ✅ Issue resolution (did stepping improve after footwork training? Yes, Chloe improved.)
  - ✅ Catch-up recommendations (Lily missing training, stepping persists → recommend 1:1)
- **Season Strategy:**
  - ✅ Projected finish (pace to X position)
  - ✅ Playoff probability (80% chance of finals)
  - ✅ Strength of schedule (upcoming opponents ranked 1st, 3rd, 7th → tough)
  - ✅ Tactical trends (we're losing midcourt battles → WA training needed)
  - ✅ Player development (Sarah improving at GS, Chloe plateauing at WA)

**Why Not 100?**
- AI insights only as good as input data (garbage in, garbage out)
- Some situations require domain expertise beyond data (politics, injuries)
- Predictions limited first half-season (insufficient samples)

**User Impact:** Coaches make decisions backed by data + AI, not intuition alone. Confidence +32 pts.
