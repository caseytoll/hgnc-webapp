## Summary of development session

This session focused on the new **printable lineup sheet** feature requested by the user and various related refinements.  Key activities included:

- **Initial implementation** of a print-friendly HTML lineup card (non-persistent scores/notes) with a new `Print Lineup Sheet` button on the game page.
- Added per-quarter shooter scoring table for GS/GA values and tests.
- Added UI button in both coach-app and parent-portal; updated share-utils and tests accordingly.
- Introduced ESLint and Prettier configuration, cleaned up lint errors, and added a handful of unit tests.
- Bumped `REVISION` and deployed initial feature; identified a runtime `ReferenceError` for `openHelpView` which was fixed by importing `help.js` early and adding a unit test.
- Added a DOM smoke test to guard against missing global handlers.
- Added inline documentation and made minor styling fixes.
- Responded to user feedback on printable sheet layout:
  - Included per-quarter GS/GA shooter scoring and removed generic "Our/Opp" labels.
  - Removed manual score fields, date/time, and score totals from the printable view; preserved a notes area.
  - Fixed column alignment and table layout with precise CSS (including header alignment and fixed widths).
  - Updated the sample PDF/PNG examples accordingly.
- Adjusted game page buttons: removed "Share Result", ensured remaining buttons fit nicely across the screen.
- Several rounds of incremental fixes for alignment, layout and styling of help/context icons and share actions.

## Lessons learned

- Import order matters: missing an import can lead to subtle runtime errors in production (e.g. help view bug).
- CSS table layout (`table-layout: fixed`) plus matching widths on header and body cells is critical for consistent print alignment.
- Keeping tests updated as features evolve prevents regressions and documents expected behavior.
- Wrangling Cloudflare Pages configuration requires care when the repo also includes a Worker (`wrangler.toml` cannot contain both `main` and `pages_build_output_dir`).

## Outstanding items

- There are still a handful of ESLint warnings; consider cleaning them in a future session.
- Documentation of nightly release/version bump process (already detailed in CLAUDE.md).

That's the full recap for today.  All requested changes have been implemented, tested, and deployed.
