# Release v2026-02-13

Release date: 2026-02-13

## Summary

### API Infrastructure Issues - Fixed Mock Data Implementation
- **Issue**: Mock data setting wasn't being used, app still tried API calls despite `useMockData: true`
- **Root Cause**: `state.dataSource` in main app.js was hardcoded to 'api', overriding API module initialization
- **Fix**: Updated `state.dataSource` initialization in `src/js/app.js` to check `API_CONFIG.useMockData`
- **Result**: App now properly uses mock data, preventing API failures and console errors
- **Next Steps**: Resolve GCP project binding and Apps Script deployment issues to restore full functionality

### Previous Fixes
- Fixed API endpoint configuration (updated from old to correct deployment ID)
- Updated production domain to serve latest build with correct API endpoint
- Verified app loads and displays teams correctly with cached data

## Technical Details

### API Configuration
- Updated `apps/coach-app/src/js/config.js` baseUrl to correct deployment ID
- Temporarily enabled `useMockData: true` to bypass failing API calls
- Apps Script deployments created but GCP project access issues prevent proper functioning

### Deployment Status
- Cloudflare Pages: ✅ Working (serving latest build)
- Google Apps Script API: ❌ Failing (GCP project configuration issues)
- Service Worker: ⚠️ Intercepting requests but failing on API calls

## Known Issues
- Background team data revalidation fails
- Player library loading fails
- Client metrics logging fails
- All issues due to Apps Script API inaccessibility

## Resolution Plan
1. ✅ **Mock Data Working**: App now properly uses mock data when API fails
2. Investigate GCP project "gen-lang-client-0364455293" access and API enablement (when ready to restore API)
3. Verify Apps Script deployment configuration (when ready to restore API)
4. Restore API functionality and disable mock data mode (when GCP issues resolved)
5. Test full app functionality with live data (when GCP issues resolved)</content>
