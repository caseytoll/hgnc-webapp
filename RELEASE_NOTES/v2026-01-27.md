# Release v2026-01-27

Release date: 2026-01-27

## Summary
- Persisted `playerCount` to `Teams` sheet (Column J) and returned in `getTeams` to avoid per-team sheet reads.
- Added `rebuildPlayerCounts` admin API to recompute player counts from team sheets.
- Added timing instrumentation to `getTeams` (metrics: `getTeams_totalMs`, `getTeams_cache_hit`, `getTeams_cache_miss_readMs`, `getTeams_loadMasterListMs`, `getTeams_cache_putMs`) with metrics recorded to `Diagnostics` sheet.
- Added client-side `teams-fetch` metric reporting and server-side diagnostics (`logClientMetric`).
- Ladder scraping integration and daily automation remain configured; updated docs to point `GS_API_URL` to latest Apps Script deployment (@56).

## Notes
- Monitor Diagnostics sheet for `getTeams_totalMs` and `app-load` entries. Consider alerts if `getTeams_totalMs > 2000ms`.
