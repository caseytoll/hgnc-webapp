# Release v2026-01-27

Release date: 2026-01-27

## Summary
- Persisted `playerCount` to `Teams` sheet (Column J) and returned in `getTeams` to avoid per-team sheet reads.
- Added `rebuildPlayerCounts` admin API to recompute player counts from team sheets.
- Added timing instrumentation to `getTeams` (metrics: `getTeams_totalMs`, `getTeams_cache_hit`, `getTeams_cache_miss_readMs`, `getTeams_loadMasterListMs`, `getTeams_cache_putMs`) with metrics recorded to `Diagnostics` sheet.
- Added client-side `teams-fetch` metric reporting and server-side diagnostics (`logClientMetric`).
- Ladder scraping integration and daily automation remain configured; updated docs to point `GS_API_URL` to latest Apps Script deployment (@56).
- Added **read-only team pages** with friendly slugs and season-aware names; generator scripts now output full static read-only pages (`public/teams/<slug>/`) and compact portal redirects (`public/hgnc-team-portal-<slug>.html` / `/p/<slug>/`).
- Added `scripts/validate-gs-api.cjs` to verify `GS_API_URL` and made CI portal generation resilient to redirects and Zone/API availability.
- Added Cloudflare Worker for proxying static team pages and CI workflows to publish the Worker; because Pages-managed domains may not be visible via the Zones API, manual route binding in the Cloudflare Dashboard is required (see `docs/CI.md`).

## Notes
- Monitor Diagnostics sheet for `getTeams_totalMs` and `app-load` entries. Consider alerts if `getTeams_totalMs > 2000ms`.
