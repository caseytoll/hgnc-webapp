# NOTE: This project serves a Cloudflare Worker (main) and also deploys Pages
# from the `dist/` directory via CI scripts. `wrangler.toml` must not include
# `pages_build_output_dir` alongside `main` (Pages validation will fail).
# Leaving `pages_build_output_dir` out prevents that conflict; Pages deploys
# continue to run from CI scripts which explicitly pass the output dir.
