## Key Rules & Regulations

### Basic Game Flow
1. **Game Start**: Jump ball at centre circle (any two players)
2. **Possession**: Team with ball advances toward opponent's goal
3. **Dead Ball**: Occurs when ball goes out of bounds or goal is scored
4. **Play Resumes**: With throw-in (out of bounds) or centre pass (goal/start)
5. **Centre Pass**: Given to team that didn't score the last goal

### Three-Second Rule
- **Maximum hold time**: 3 seconds before passing or shooting
- **Application**: Any player with ball in hand
- **Exception**: None (strictly enforced)
- **Infringement**: Loss of possession to opposing team

---

## Movement & Footwork

### The One-Foot Rule (Most Important Rule)
**Definition**: A player catching or receiving the ball can only land on one foot initially. The landing foot is the "pivot foot" and cannot be lifted until the ball is released.

**How It Works**:
1. Player catches ball while moving → lands on one foot
2. Can step with other foot (called "step")
3. Pivot foot cannot move until ball is released
4. Can only take 1 step with non-pivot foot
5. Must pass or shoot within 3 seconds

**Example Sequence**:
- Player A catches ball, lands on right foot
- Right foot = pivot foot (cannot move)
- Can step once with left foot
- Must release ball before picking up right foot again

### Footwork Violations
- **Travelling**: Taking more than one step with non-pivot foot
- **Footwork breach**: Lifting pivot foot before releasing ball
- **Penalty**: Free pass to opposing team at that location

### Pass-to-Self
- A player cannot bounce the ball to themselves and catch it (basketball style)
- The ball must be passed to another player

---

## Possession & Contact

### Legal Contact (Defence Only)
- **Defending distance**: Must be within 0.9m of ball holder to contest
- **Legal defence**: Arms up, body positioning, not touching
- **Contact allowed**: None (no pushing, pulling, holding)
- **Exception**: None - all contact is an infringement

### Blocking & Obstruction
- **Standing in opponent's path**: Without 0.9m distance is obstruction
- **Moving into path**: Same as standing obstruction
- **Contact while defending**: Automatically an infringement
- **Contact while attacking**: Also an infringement (both ways)

### Intercepting
- **Legal**: Catching/deflecting ball that's in flight between players
- **Timing**: Before the pass is "received" by intended player
- **Consequence**: Ball goes to intercepting team

### Out of Bounds
- **Definition**: Ball leaves the court (crosses sideline or baseline)
- **Restart**: Throw-in from where ball crossed the line
- **Who throws**: Opposing team to the one that put it out
- **Distance**: Throw must land infield or it's another throw-in

---

## Shooting & Scoring

### Shooting Requirements
1. **Who can shoot**: Only GS and GA
2. **Location**: Must be within the goal circle
3. **Foot position**: Both feet outside the goal circle when releasing
4. **Hand release**: Ball must leave hand(s) before feet position check
5. **Arc**: Ball must enter goal ring from above (not from side)

### Scoring a Goal
- **Definition**: Ball goes through the goal ring from above
- **Points awarded**: 1 point
- **Dead ball**: Automatically stops play
- **Restart**: Centre pass to non-scoring team

### Shooting Contests
- **Defending during shot**: Defender can be within 0.9m with arms up
- **Contact during shot**: Infringement → free throw (bonus shot)
- **No blocking rule**: Cannot block the shot path (different from basketball)

### Shooting Accuracy Metrics
- **Attempts**: Every shot taken
- **Goals**: Every successful shot
- **Accuracy %**: Goals ÷ Attempts × 100

---

## Defensive Strategies

### Man-to-Man Defence (Mandatory)
**Definition**: Each defender is responsible for marking one specific opponent

**Requirements**:
- Can only play a specific opponent
- Cannot play "zones" (defending areas)
- Must stay with assigned player throughout possession
- When assignment changes (e.g., through substitution), defence changes

**Advantages**:
- Clear accountability
- Develops individual defensive skills
- Works well with pressing defence
- Emphasizes communication

**Disadvantages**:
- One-on-one mismatch issues
- Foul trouble (players getting beaten regularly)
- Less flexibility against mobile teams

### Zone Defence (NOT PERMITTED)
- Netball Australia rules explicitly prohibit zone defence
- Players cannot defend areas; must defend people
- Umpires will call infringements if zones are detected

### Defensive Positioning

**Back Court Defence** (Defensive Third)
- **GK**: Marks GS directly
- **GD**: Marks GA, cuts supply lines
- **WD**: Pressures WA, prevents transitions
- **Formation**: Triangle/diamond shape, defensive depth

**Transition Defence** (Centre Third)
- **WD vs WA**: Critical first pressure
- **Centre**: Tracks opposing centre (all-court player)
- **GD**: Drops back to help GK

**Pressing Defence** (Attacking Third)
- **GA defender (GD)**: Pressures GA aggressively
- **GS defender (GK)**: Full court press (if rule allows)
- **Purpose**: Disrupt attacking rhythm, force turnovers

### Defensive Pressure Levels
1. **Tight defence** (0.3m): Aggressive, high contact risk
2. **Contested (0.9m)**: Legal maximum defensive distance
3. **Loose defence** (2m+): Prevents fast breaks, creates space
4. **Help defence**: Team-mate covering second line
