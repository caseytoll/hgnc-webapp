## 🔧 RECENT FIXES (Last 2 Weeks)

### v823 (2025-12-07) - Project Structure & Code Cleanup
- ✅ Reorganized project structure:
  - `src/includes/` for all JavaScript modules
  - `src/icons/` for icon assets
  - `src/styles.html` for CSS
  - `tests/` for test files
  - `docs/` for all documentation
  - `scripts/` for deployment scripts
- ✅ Removed 140+ lines of diagnostic logging code
- ✅ Removed 14 console.log statements from Code.js
- ✅ Fixed icon file naming (kebab-case)
- ✅ Enhanced .claspignore for cleaner repo

### v819-820 (2025-12-07) - Icon Standardization
- ✅ Fixed Offensive Leaders icon display
- ✅ Fixed Defensive Wall icon display
- ✅ Unified icon attribute from 4 types to single `data-icon` pattern
- ✅ Added missing icon URLs to server-data JSON
- ✅ Updated icon file content (were duplicates)
- ✅ Added global variable exposure for all 4 icons

### v818 (2025-12-06) - Root Cause: Blank Insights Page
- ✅ **Root Cause Found:** Missing HTML closing tags for insights-view container
- ✅ **Resolution:** Added proper closing tags (lines 599-601 in index.html)
- ✅ **Impact:** All insight sub-views now render as full-page views
- ✅ **Lesson:** Parent `display: none` overrides child CSS at layout level

### v775-v817 (2025-12-06) - Debugging Campaign
- ✅ Added parent chain visibility diagnostics (v815)
- ✅ Fixed control flow in showView() (v789-790)
- ✅ Added overflow visibility rules (v811)
- ✅ Added min-height to dashboard (v813)
- ✅ Tested CSS height approaches (px, %, vh units)
- ✅ Documented all findings for future reference

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & EDGE CASES

### Currently No Critical Issues
All major features tested and working in production.

### Potential Edge Cases (Not Reported)
- Very large rosters (100+ players) - Performance untested
- Concurrent user edits - No conflict resolution
- Extremely slow network - Timeout behavior not optimized
- Very old browsers - IE11 not supported

### Low-Priority Improvements (Not Urgent)
- ⚠️ 100+ forEach loops in render functions (already cached, low priority)
- ⚠️ 80+ getElementById calls (already cached in hot paths)
- ⚠️ js-render.html is large (3956 lines, could split)
- ⚠️ Some duplicate utility functions across files
- ⚠️ Could benefit from TypeScript for type safety

---

## 📋 POTENTIAL FUTURE WORK

### High Priority (User-Facing)
1. **Enhanced Player Analysis**
   - Per-game player performance tracking
   - Player trend analysis over season
   - Individual player leaderboards

2. **Advanced Team Analytics**
   - Team lineup combinations analysis
   - Quarter-by-quarter performance trends
   - Historical season comparisons

3. **Mobile Optimizations**
   - Gesture-based navigation (swipe)
   - Offline mode enhancements
   - App shell architecture

### Medium Priority (Developer Experience)
4. **TypeScript Migration**
   - Type safety for large codebase
   - Better IDE support
   - Reduce runtime errors

5. **Component Architecture**
   - Extract render functions into components
   - Improve code reusability
   - Better testing coverage

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Convert remaining forEach loops to functional style
   - Implement Service Worker
   - Optimize large render functions

### Low Priority (Infrastructure)
7. **Enhanced CI/CD**
   - Automated visual regression testing
   - Performance regression detection
   - Automated rollback on failures

8. **Documentation Automation**
   - Auto-generate API docs
   - Auto-update CHANGELOG
   - Code coverage reporting

## 🎯 OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Performance (Quick Wins)
| Opportunity | Savings | Effort | Priority |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|
| Insights detail view forEach optimization | 5-10ms | Medium | LOW |
| Remaining getElementById caching | 1-2ms | Low | LOW |
| Game iteration loop optimization | 10-20ms | High | LOW |
| querySelectorAll event handler caching | <1ms | Low | LOW |

**Assessment:** Critical paths already optimized (stats caching 95% effective). Further work shows diminishing returns for infrequent operations.

### Code Quality
| Item | Current | Recommendation |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Lines of code | ~23,860 | Acceptable for feature set |
| Documentation | ~3,500 lines | Excellent |
| Test coverage | Smoke tests only | Add unit tests for core logic |
| TypeScript | Not used | Consider for next major version |

## 💡 LESSONS FOR NEXT DEVELOPER

If onboarding a new team member, emphasize:

1. **Read DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES.md FIRST** - It contains critical patterns and non-negotiables
2. **Always search before implementing** - Similar features likely exist
3. **Test in browser DevTools before deploying** - Catches most issues immediately
4. **Use the deployment script** - `./scripts/efficient-deploy.sh` handles everything
5. **Keep versions small** - 823 versions shows value of frequent small deploys
6. **Document as you go** - CHANGELOG and inline comments help future you
7. **The -i flag is not optional** - It maintains the stable production URL
8. **Cache strategically** - 95% of stats calculations can be eliminated
9. **Parent CSS overrides child** - When height fails, check parent visibility
10. **Multi-tier fallbacks work** - Server → Client → CDN → Default
