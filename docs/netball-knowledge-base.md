## 2. Position Roles & Responsibilities

### 2.1 Attacking Unit (GS, GA, WA, C)

#### Goal Shooter (GS)
**Role:** Primary scorer
- **Restriction:** Only position that *must* stay in attacking third and goal circle
- **Key Responsibility:** Converting opportunities into goals
- **Typical Stats:** Scores 60-70% of team's goals
- **Key Skills:**
  - Accurate shooting (85%+ conversion ideal)
  - Positioning in goal circle
  - Timing and rhythm
  - Handling poor passes from GA/WA
- **What to Look For in Stats:**
  - High goals when on court = skilled finisher or excellent feeding
  - Low goals despite playing time = poor feeding OR excellent opposition defense
  - Consistency across games = reliable scorer
- **Chemistry:** Works as a pair with GA; needs good feeding from WA and C timing

#### Goal Attack (GA)
**Role:** Secondary scorer AND feeder
- **Flexibility:** Can play in attacking and center thirds (more flexible than GS)
- **Dual Purpose:** Can score (20-40% of team goals) OR feed (set up GS)
- **Scoring GA:** High personal goal output, may leave GS starved
- **Feeding GA:** Lower personal goals, but sets up GS effectively
- **Key Skills:**
  - Versatile shooting ability
  - Circle movement and court vision
  - Feeding accuracy to GS
  - Transition between attacking and supporting roles
- **What to Look For in Stats:**
  - Goals vs GS split tells the story (balanced = varied attack, unbalanced = one primary scorer)
  - GS-GA combined goals = attacking unit strength
- **Chemistry:** GS-GA pair should develop timing; alternating players disrupts this

#### Wing Attack (WA)
**Role:** Primary feeder to the shooting court
- **Restriction:** Cannot enter defending third
- **Key Responsibility:** Delivering ball to GS/GA in good positions for shooting
- **Scoring:** Cannot score, but impact shows in goals scored by GS/GA when on court
- **Key Skills:**
  - Accurate passing and feeding
  - Court positioning and spacing
  - Timing passes for shooters to move and catch
  - Quick decision-making under pressure
- **What to Look For in Stats:**
  - Goals FOR when WA is on court = indicator of feeding quality
  - Less visible than scorers, but fundamental to team success
  - Team scoring drops when WA changes = feeding critical to system
- **Chemistry:** WA-GS/GA chemistry develops over 8-12 quarters together

#### Centre (C)
**Role:** THE CONNECTOR - appears in both attacking and defensive units
- **Unique Position:** Only position that can move in all three thirds
- **Crucial Function:**
  - Attacking link: Gets ball from WD/C/WA into shooting court
  - Defensive link: Transitions balls from defence to quick counter-attack
  - Game pace controller: Can slow down or quicken play based on game situation
- **Key Skills:**
  - Excellent ball handling
  - Court vision and spatial awareness
  - Fitness (high workrate position)
  - Reads both attacking and defensive situations
- **What to Look For in Stats:**
  - Goals FOR with this Centre = attacking efficiency
  - Goals AGAINST with this Centre = defensive efficiency
  - **Dual Plus-Minus:** Look at both attacking (+goals for) AND defensive (-goals against)
  - Best Centres improve both attacking and defensive efficiency
  - Centre change = biggest performance swing in data (if goals FOR and AGAINST both change)
- **Chemistry:** Takes 6-8 quarters to settle with new defensive partner (GD/GK) or attacking partner

### 2.2 Defensive Unit (GK, GD, WD, C)

#### Goal Keeper (GK)
**Role:** Last line of defence against opposition GS
- **Restriction:** Only position that *must* stay in defending third and goal circle
- **Key Responsibility:** Pressure opposition shooter to reduce goals conceded
- **Measurement:** Goals against per quarter when on court
- **Key Skills:**
  - Defensive positioning and pressure
  - Reading shooter's movement
  - Communication with GD partner
  - Quick hands and reach
- **What to Look For in Stats:**
  - Goals against per quarter with this GK = defensive reliability
  - GK-GD pair consistency = partnership strength
  - Goals against spike when GK changes = new pair needs time to develop
- **Chemistry:** Requires 10-15 quarters with GD partner to build defensive communication

#### Goal Defence (GD)
**Role:** Pressure opposition GA and support GK
- **Restriction:** Defending third and goal circle only
- **Key Responsibility:** Defend GA and feed from WA, reducing feeding effectiveness
- **Measurement:** Goals against per quarter, plus effectiveness against GA
- **Key Skills:**
  - Defensive positioning on GA
  - Anticipating opponent's movement
  - Communication with adjacent defenders
  - Switching/helping system awareness
- **What to Look For in Stats:**
  - Goals against per quarter = primary metric
  - Goals against spike in specific quarters = when GD changed
  - Consistency year-to-year with same GK = strong pair
- **Chemistry:** Central to defensive unit stability; same GK-GD pairs show lower goals against

#### Wing Defence (WD)
**Role:** Pressure opposition WA
- **Restriction:** Cannot enter attacking third
- **Key Responsibility:** Disrupt opposition feeding, pressure WA before ball reaches circle
- **Measurement:** Indirect (show in goals against), direct assessment harder without turnover data
- **Key Skills:**
  - Lateral movement and anticipation
  - Ball interception
  - Pressure on the ball
  - Positioning at the thirds line
- **What to Look For in Stats:**
  - Goals against drops when this WD plays = positive impact
  - Goals against drops significantly in Q2/Q3 = timing suggests fatigue or system adjustment
  - WD change + goal change = indicates pressure effectiveness
- **Chemistry:** Works with WA opposition; less direct partnership with GD-GK, but system-dependent

### 2.3 Positional Pairings & Chemistry

**Attacking Pair (GS-GA):**
- **Ideal:** Both comfortable scoring, with clear primary-secondary roles
- **Development:** Need 8-12 quarters together to develop rhythm
- **Indicator:** Combined goals stability, balanced split
- **Risk:** Over-rotation disrupts chemistry

**Defensive Pair (GK-GD):**
- **Ideal:** Consistent partnership, clear communication roles
- **Development:** Need 10-15 quarters together for full communication
- **Indicator:** Goals against consistency, no spike when pair is together
- **Risk:** Frequent changes = inconsistent defense

**Wider Units (GS-GA-WA with C, or GK-GD-WD with C):**
- **Center Impact:** Most measurable in how goals FOR/AGAINST change with Centre change
- **Attacking Efficiency:** (GS + GA goals) / games with this attacking unit
- **Defensive Efficiency:** (Goals against) / games with this defensive unit

---

## 3. Tactical Strategies

### 3.1 Attacking Strategies

**Hold-and-Feed System**
- GS waits in circle, receiving high-quality feeds from GA/WA
- Pros: High conversion rate, structured attacking
- Cons: Predictable to opposition, may stagnate if GS marked well
- **When it Works:** Against defenses that play loose
- **Signs in Data:** High GS goal percentage, but total team goals may be moderate

**Fast-Break / Transition Attack**
- Quick ball movement from defense to attack, catch opposition off-guard
- Create scoring opportunities before defense is set
- **When it Works:** Against teams that rotate slowly or are fatigued
- **Signs in Data:** Goals spike in specific quarters, especially after defensive rebounds

**Varied Feeding Pattern**
- Ball moves WA → C → GA, with different entry angles to goal circle
- Makes it harder for defense to predict shooting position
- **When it Works:** Against disciplined defensive units
- **Signs in Data:** Balanced GS-GA split, moderate but consistent scoring

**Patient Build-Up**
- Methodical ball movement with multiple passes before shooting
- Ensures best scoring opportunity rather than forcing shots
- **When it Works:** When ahead in score, want to control game tempo
- **Signs in Data:** Moderate scoring rate but high conversion percentage

### 3.2 Defensive Strategies

**Player-on-Player Defence**
- Each defender marks one opposition player closely
- Requires good communication and switch awareness
- **When it Works:** When your team has speed/fitness advantage
- **Signs in Data:** Consistent goals against, spike if a specific opposition player gets on court

**Zone Defence**
- Defenders cover areas of the court rather than individual players
- Opposition tries to move ball around to find gaps
- **When it Works:** When opposition has very strong individual players
- **Signs in Data:** Goals against may spike if opposition finds gaps, but can be effective against stars

**Aggressive Pressing**
- Pressure opposition at thirds line
- Try to force turnovers before ball reaches shooting court
- **When it Works:** Against teams with poor passing or young players
- **Risks:** Can leave gaps if opposition passes around pressure; fatigues your team

**Defensive Rotations/Switches**
- Defenders swap assignments when opposition moves
- Complex system requiring lots of communication
- **When it Works:** Against fluid, moving opposition
- **Risks:** If communication breaks down, gaps appear and goals conceded spike

**Allowing Looks but Limiting Good Ones**
- Let opposition shoot, but from long/difficult angles
- GK-GD focus on making GS uncomfortable
- **When it Works:** Against shooters with lower accuracy
- **Signs in Data:** High shots against, but goals against per quarter still reasonable

### 3.3 Game Management Tactics

**Rotation Strategy (Fairness vs Winning):**
- **Development Rotation:** Even playing time, sub everyone in Q4 (learns new players earlier)
- **Competitive Rotation:** Establish best lineup, limited bench (max winning potential)
- **Balanced Rotation:** Key players more Q1-Q3, rotate more in Q4 (good balance)
- **Indicator:**  Lineups show pattern (same starts, heavy Q4 bench = development; minimal changes = competitive)

**Halftime Adjustments:**
- Change defensive system if opposition found gaps
- Adjust feeding if GS-GA not clicking
- Refresh lineup if fatigue showing
- **Indicator:** Goals against drops Q3 vs Q2, or goals FOR increases = adjustment worked

**Quarter-Specific Tactics:**

**Q1 - Start Strong:**
- Put best ribbon lineups to establish momentum
- High energy, establish pattern
- Goal: Win Q1 convincingly (winning Q1 = ~65% win game)

**Q2 - Maintain or Build:**
- Keep pressure, don't fade
- Adjust if opposition countering your system
- Goal: Win or draw Q2, don't let deficit develop

**Q3 - Post-Halftime Critical:**
- Risk of lethargy, but also where halftime adjustments show effect
- Re-establish second-half intensity
- Goal: Win Q3 or stay within 3 goals

**Q4 - Closing Strong:**
- Use your best closers if ahead (maybe sacrifice fairness for win)
- If behind, go aggressive with rotations
- Goal: Win Q4 to secure win or comeback

**Timeout Usage:**
- One 30-sec timeout per half
- Best used to reset offense if turnover-heavy, or to call defensive set if opposition scoring runs

### 3.4 Opposition Adaptation

**Reading Opposition Strengths:**
- Strong GA? GD focuses pressure there
- Strong WA feeder? WD presses at thirds line
- Strong C? Mark closely and disrupt flow

**Mid-Game Adjustments (Quarter-to-Quarter):**
- If opposition scored 7+ in a quarter: Change defensive system next quarter
- If your team scored only 3 in a quarter: Adjust feeding or shooting position in next quarter

**Recognizing Patterns:**
- Opposition playing loose on one side? Exploit with ball movement to that side
- Opposition pressing high? Use fast breaks to counter
- Opposition tired? Push pace in Q4

## 6. Performance Metrics & Analysis

### 6.1 Common Statistics in Netball

**Scoring Metrics:**
- **Goals For (GF):** Total goals team scored
- **Goals Against (GA):** Total goals opposition scored
- **Differential:** GF - GA (positive = winning score, negative = losing score)
- **Goals Per Game (Avg):** Total goals ÷ games played
- **Win/Loss/Draw Record:** W-L-D format, Points = 4W + 2D

**Position-Specific Metrics:**
- **Shooter Goals:** Individual GS/GA goal totals per game or per quarter
- **Goals Against (Defensive):** Points conceded per quarter when specific GK/GD on court
- **Playing Time:** Quarters played, indicating coach confidence and rotation

**Unit Metrics (Attacking):**
- **GS-GA Combined Goals:** Total points from shooting combination
- **Team Goals When Unit On Court:** Indirect measure of feeding quality
- **Shooting Percentage:** Goals ÷ Shots attempted (estimated from data)

**Unit Metrics (Defensive):**
- **Goals Against w/ Specific GK-GD Pair:** Direct measure of defensive effectiveness
- **Goals Against per Quarter with Unit:** Indicates consistency
- **Variability:** Std deviation of goals against across quarters with same unit

**Advanced Metrics:**
- **Plus-Minus (+/-):** (Team goals when unit on) - (Team goals against when unit on)
  - Positive = unit helps win quarters
  - Used to identify best attacking/defensive combos
- **Strength of Schedule:** Average opponent ladder ranking in upcoming fixtures
- **Efficiency Rating:** Goals per possession (estimated from available data)

### 6.2 What Stats Indicate by Position

**GS (Goal Shooter):**
- **High Goals:** Skilled finisher OR excellent feeding from GA/WA
- **Low Goals Despite Playtime:** Bad feeding OR excellent opposition defense
- **Consistency:** Reliable scorer or affected by opposition
- **Variation:** Suggests dependency on specific feeders

**GA (Goal Attack):**
- **High Goals:** "Scoring GA" - primary scorer role
- **Low Goals but GS High:** "Feeding GA" - supporting role
- **Balanced With GS:** Varied attack system
- **Split Indicates:** Team attacking strategy

**WA (Wing Attack):**
- **Indirect Measure:** Look at team goals when WA on court
- **Feeding Quality:** If team scores more with certain WA, that WA feeding well
- **Key Indicator:** Goals spike when WA enters, drop when exits = critical feeder

**Centre (C):**
- **Dual Impact:** Check both attacking AND defensive efficiency
- **Best Centres:** Improve both (+goals for and -goals against)
- **Workrate:** Often plays full game or near-full game
- **Impact Measure:** Biggest performance swings often tied to C change

**GK/GD (Defensive Pair):**
- **Primary Metric:** Goals against per quarter when on court
- **Reliability:** Consistency (low variance = reliable)
- **Pair Chemistry:** if different GK/GD combos have very different stats = chemistry matters
- **Pressure Quality:** If goals against are 3+ in early quarter but drop to 1-2 later = adjustment happening

### 6.3 Interpreting Stats by Context

**Team Strength Assessment:**
- **Winning Record + Controllable Scoring (not wild swings):** Consistent team
- **Winning Record + Wild Scoring Swings:** Inconsistent team, high risk
- **Losing Record + Low Goals For:** Offense is issue
- **Losing Record + High Goals Against:** Defense is issue

**Individual Performance:**
- **Compare to Position Benchmarks:**
  - U11 shooter: 2-3 goals/quarter = good
  - U13 shooter: 3-5 goals/quarter = good
  - U15 shooter: 5-8 goals/quarter = good
- **Compare to Season Average:** Above average game = standout performance
- **Compare to Context:** Against ladder-leader = different expectation than against basement team

**Trend Analysis:**
- **Improving:** Stats show week-on-week improvement (scoring up, goals against down)
- **Declining:** Stats show regression (scoring down, goals against up)
- **Stable:** Consistent performance game-to-game

## 7. Common Coaching Challenges & Solutions

### 7.1 Developing Combination Chemistry

**Challenge:** New GS-GA pairing not clicking, scoring drops

**Why It Happens:**
- Need 8-12 quarters together to develop timing
- Different shooting styles, feeding patterns
- Lack of understanding of each other's movement

**Solutions:**
1. **Keep pairing together** for at least 3-4 games minimum
2. **Target practice:** Specific drills on GS-GA combinations in training
3. **High-low sequence:** Practice GA setting up GS in specific positions
4. **Communication:** Ensure both talking on court (calling for ball)
5. **Patience:** Stats may look worse before better (give time)

**Timeline:** Expect improvement Q3-4 of consistent pairing

### 7.2 Building Bench Depth

**Challenge:** Best lineup strong, but bench players underdeveloped, limits rotation

**Why It Happens:**
- Coaches default to best team in competitive matches
- Bench players get limited court time, stay underdeveloped
- Can't sustain through season without rotation (fatigue, illnesses)

**Solutions:**
1. **Planned development games:** Use lower-pressure matches for bench rotation
2. **Specific positions:** Rotate one position at a time (not wholesale lineup change)
3. **Mentorship:** Pair bench player with star in that position during training
4. **Quarter-based development:** Give bench players full Q4 to build consistency
5. **Clear progression path:** Show player what they need to do to earn more time

**Expected Outcome:** 2-3 full seasons of development to build real bench depth

### 7.3 Managing Fatigue (Especially Q4)

**Challenge:** Team scoring drops 30%+ in Q4, loses close matches in last quarter

**Why It Happens:**
- Junior players have less fitness than adults
- Cumulative fatigue from 12 quarters of movement
- Mental fatigue (concentration drops when tired)
- Dehydration in hot weather (especially February-March in Australia)

**Solutions:**
1. **Hydration breaks:** Ensure water available between quarters
2. **Fitness training:** Focus on interval fitness (relevant to netball quarter structure)
3. **Strategic rotation:** Don't play best players all 4 quarters in non-critical games
4. **Tempo management:** In Q4, control game pace to minimize exhausting sprints
5. **Fresh legs:** Have fresh subs ready to bring on in Q4 for key positions
6. **Mental reset:** At halftime, coach might play energizing music, give specific Q3 goals

**Expected Outcome:** Q4 scoring stabilizes within 1-2 goals of Q1-Q2 levels

### 7.4 Balancing Development vs Winning

**Challenge:** Want to develop all players, but need to win to stay competitive

**Why It's Hard:**
- Fairness (giving all players time) conflicts with winning (using best players)
- Pressure from parents/club to win
- Young players may lose confidence if played against strong opposition
- But not playing = no development

**Solutions (By Age Group):**

**U11-U13 (Priority: Development):**
- Rotate all players in every game
- Use Q4 for experimentation
- Accept some losses for learning
- Frame wins to players/parents as "team learning"

**U15 (Priority: Balance):**
- Play best team Q1-Q3, rotate Q4
- Keep developing players on bench for continuity
- Some games may be "competitive" (minimize rotation), others "development" (maximize)
- Clear communication about strategy

**U17+ (Priority: Winning with Development):**
- Best team plays Q1-Q3, rotate in Q4 or in safer leads/deficits
- Limited true development time in competitive season
- Use pre-season or less important matches for experimentation
- Development happens in training, not matches

**Communications Strategy:**
- Tell players exactly when they'll get court time and why
- Frame rotation as "development pathway" not "being benched"
- Show parent/player communication about team strategy

### 7.5 Adapting to Strong Opposition

**Challenge:** Playing against ladder-leader, team collapses, loses big

**Why It Happens:**
- Confidence affected by opponent's reputation
- Opposition experience means they exploit weaknesses quickly
- Physical/skill gap is real (can't close in one game)
- Young players may lose focus against "intimidating" opponent

**Solutions (Multi-Match Approach):**
1. **First Match:** Learn what opposition does well (their patterns, strong positions)
2. **Pre-Match Talk:** Focus on "our game" not "their reputation"
3. **Tactical Adjustments:**
   - If opposition GS very strong: GK plays very close, don't leave gaps
   - If opposition WA very strong: WD presses early, disrupts feeding
   - If opposition C very influential: Mark C closely, disrupt their connections
4. **Mental Resilience:** Celebrate good quarters/plays, don't dwell on big differences
5. **Second Match:** Apply learnings from first match

**Expected Outcome:** Performance improves each time you face same opposition

### 7.6 Consistency Issues (Wild Game-to-Game Variation)

**Challenge:** Team scores 40 goals one game, 22 the next; can't depend on them

**Why It Happens:**
- Lineup changes disrupt chemistry
- Opposition variety (strong vs weak) creates natural variation
- Fatigue/injury affects lineups
- Mental game (confidence affects performance)
- Young players naturally inconsistent

**Solutions:**
1. **Stable lineups:** Keep same attacking combination for 3+ games
2. **Scout opposition:** Only variation should be tactical adjustments, not wholesale changes
3. **Training consistency:** Same drills, same patterns, same emphasis week-to-week
4. **Mental consistency:** Pre-match routine, confidence-building talks
5. **Physical preparation:** Consistent warm-up, hydration, equipment
6. **Honest feedback:** If scoring inconsistent, analyze what changed (lineup? tactics? opposition?)

**Expected Outcome:** Std deviation of goals decreases, average ±2 goals becomes normal variation

### 7.7 Defensive Inconsistency (Goals Against Spike)

**Challenge:** Some quarters defense is tight (4 goals against), some quarters leak (7-8)

**Why It Happens:**
- Defensive pair changes disrupt communication
- Opposition adjusts and finds gaps
- Mental lapses (concentration drops)
- Fatigue (usually worse Q3-Q4)
- Wrong system against this opposition

**Solutions:**
1. **Keep GK-GD pair consistent:** Defend together 10+ quarters minimum
2. **Defensive system clarity:** Ensure all 5 defenders understand exactly what they're doing
3. **Communication emphasis:** Have GD/GK calling all switches, rotations, assignments
4. **Halftime adjustments:** If conceding 7+ in Q2, change system for Q3
5. **Pressure concept:** Agree whether you're playing loose (let them shoot) or tight (pressure the ball)
6. **Opposition-specific prep:** Against strong scoring teams, emphasize tighter defense (may concede more possessions but fewer quality shots)

**Expected Outcome:** Goals against stabilizes to 4-5 per quarter range (within system's capability)

## 9. Notes for AI Integration & Prompt Engineering

This knowledge base should inform AI coaching insights by:

### 9.1 Rule-Based Constraints
- Never suggest a player move to an ineligible third (WA can't defend, GD can't attack)
- Never suggest tracking stats we can't see (turnovers, passes, intercepts)
- Frame recommendations within netball rules and position restrictions

### 9.2 Context-Aware Recommendations
- U11 team with 20-goal scoring variations = NORMAL (don't overreact)
- U15 team with same = potential consistency issue
- Adult team with same = significant problem
- **Always check age group before assessing performance**

### 9.3 Chemistry & Pairing Insights
- GS-GA change = expect 1-2 games adjustment period
- GK-GD change = expect 2-3 games adjustment period
- Same pair stabilizes after 8-12 cumulative quarters
- **Flag if same pair changes frequently** (prevents chemistry from developing)

### 9.4 Tactical Observations
- Goals FOR spike + same attacking unit on court = unit working well
- Goals AGAINST spike + GK-GD pair changed = pair needs time to develop
- Goals change + C changed = Centre is fundamental impact position
- **Connect lineup changes to performance changes** in analysis

### 9.5 Age-Appropriate Framing
- U11 feedback: Celebrate effort, fun, teamwork. Avoid criticism.
- U13 feedback: Positive with constructive development focus
- U17+ feedback: Direct tactical analysis, competitive framing

### 9.6 Performance Benchmarks by Age
- When analyzing goals, compare to age-appropriate benchmarks
- High variation in junior = normal, don't recommend changes
- When metrics fall below age benchmarks, diagnose why (injury? lineup? tactics?)

### 9.7 Strength of Schedule Context
- Same team scoring 25 goals vs 35 goals? Check opposition ladder position
- Strong opponents = lower team scoring expected
- Weak opponents = higher team scoring expected
- **Factor opponent difficulty into performance assessment**

### 9.8 Long-Term Development View
- Single game outlier = don't overestimate (could be one-off)
- 3+ game trend = likely real improvement/decline
- Season arc = U11 highly variable, U17 more consistent
- **Recommend patience for development changes, urgency for decline trends**

## 10. Updating This Knowledge Base

**Purpose of Living Document:**
This knowledge base will be refined over time as:
- Coaches use app and provide feedback
- New rules updates (every 2-3 years via World Netball)
- New research on netball coaching/development emerges
- Application-specific patterns become clearer

**Sections to Expand in Future:**
- Specific NFNL competition patterns/history
- Detailed video examples of tactics
- Player development profiles by position
- Common injury patterns and prevention
- Mental resilience coaching approaches
- Gender-specific coaching considerations (if expanding to mixed or male netball)

**Feedback Loop:**
- Coaches should report instances where AI recommendations didn't match netball context
- Knowledge base updated monthly/quarterly based on feedback
- Version control through git tracking
