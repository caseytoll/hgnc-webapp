# Data Exposure Report — Squadi / NetballConnect Platform

**Date:** 23 February 2026 (updated 24 February 2026)
**Reporter:** Casey Toll — Parent and coach at Hazel Glen Netball Club
**Severity:** Critical — Children's personal information openly accessible online

---

## What Happened?

The registration system used by netball clubs across Australia — **NetballConnect**, built by a company called **Squadi (World Sport Action)** — has a serious security flaw. The personal details of every registered player are accessible to anyone on the internet. **No login, no password, and no special tools are required.**

The information exposed includes:

- **Children's full names**
- **Children's dates of birth**
- **Parent/guardian email addresses**
- **Parent/guardian phone numbers**
- **Which team and competition they play in**

This is not a theoretical risk. I was able to look up my own daughter's full details — her name, date of birth, my email address, and my phone number — in a matter of seconds.

## How Was This Discovered?

I'm a parent and coach at Hazel Glen Netball Club. In my own time, I've been building a personal team management app to help with coaching duties. As part of that hobby project, I was looking at how to pull in publicly available ladder and fixture data from the Squadi system.

During that work, I discovered that the NetballConnect website contains a **secret access key embedded in its publicly visible code** — the equivalent of publishing a password on the front page of a website. Using this key, I found that anyone can retrieve the full personal details of every registered player on the platform.

I was not looking for this vulnerability. I discovered it by accident. The app I'm building is an unofficial personal project — it is not endorsed by or affiliated with Hazel Glen Netball Club, Nillumbik Force, or Netball Victoria.

## How Easy Is It to Access This Data?

**Extremely easy.** To put it in non-technical terms:

1. **Visit the NetballConnect website** — the access key is sent to your browser automatically
2. **View the page source** — something any browser can do (right-click → View Source)
3. **Copy the access key** — it's clearly labelled in the code
4. **Use it to request player details** — paste a web address into your browser with the key

**A curious teenager could do this.** No hacking knowledge, no special software, no criminal tools. Just a web browser.

There is also nothing stopping someone from writing a simple program to **automatically download every player record on the platform in a matter of hours**. There are no limits on how many requests can be made or how fast.

## How Many People Are Affected?

### Confirmed

I verified the exposure against my own club (Hazel Glen Netball Club) in the 2026 NFNA Saturday Autumn competition:

- **10 Hazel Glen teams checked** — all 90 players' personal details were accessible
- **100 teams total in the NF competition** — approximately 900 players exposed in this one local competition alone
- **My daughter's full record was returned** — name, date of birth (she is 13), my email, my phone number

### Estimated National Scale

- The platform contains **over 1.27 million player registration records** for netball alone
- Competition records go back to **at least 2022** — old data is still accessible
- **Conservative estimate: 300,000 to 500,000 children's records are exposed** (many players re-register each season, so there are duplicate records, but historical data including old contact details remains accessible)

### It's Not Just Netball

I also confirmed that the **same access key works on two other Squadi sports platforms**:

- **Basketball** (`api-basketball.squadi.com`) — player PII confirmed exposed
- **Football/Soccer** (`api.squadi.com`) — player PII confirmed exposed, using a different server but the same access key

Squadi's three main sports platforms — netball, basketball, and football — are all affected. The total number of affected individuals across all sports could exceed **one million**.

## How Long Has This Been Going On?

Using the Internet Archive (a public service that takes snapshots of websites over time), I checked historical versions of the NetballConnect website:

- **The earliest snapshot available is from November 2023**
- **The access key was already present in December 2023** — over 2 years ago
- **The same key has been present in every version of the website since then** — it has never been changed
- Player data from competitions labelled "2022" is still accessible

**This data has been exposed for at least 2 years, possibly longer.** During that time, the key has never been changed, which suggests the company has no process for monitoring or rotating access credentials.

**There is no way to know if someone else has already downloaded this data.** Only Squadi can check their systems to determine if any bulk data extraction has occurred.

## What Could Someone Do With This Data?

The combination of information available creates serious risks:

- **Contact children's families directly** — an attacker knows the child's name, age, which team they play for, where they play (venue addresses are also public), and has the parent's email and phone number

- **Send convincing fake messages** — for example: *"Hi [parent name], this is regarding [child name]'s registration for [competition name] at [venue]. Please click here to update your details."* Every detail needed to make this message believable is available through the platform

- **Download the entire national database** — with no limits on access speed, a simple automated script could extract every record on the platform in hours

- **Identity-related fraud** — children's dates of birth combined with parent names and contact details provide a foundation for identity fraud, which is particularly concerning for minors whose credit histories are rarely monitored

---

## Why This Matters Legally

Under Australian law, organisations that handle personal information have specific obligations:

- **The Privacy Act 1988** requires organisations to take reasonable steps to protect personal information from unauthorised access. Publishing an access key in publicly visible code does not meet this standard.

- **The Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme** requires organisations to notify the **Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)** and all affected individuals when a data breach is likely to result in serious harm. Children's personal details being openly accessible for 2+ years almost certainly meets this threshold.

- **Children's data receives heightened protection** under Australian privacy law. The majority of records in this system belong to minors.

- **Both Squadi and the sporting organisations** (such as Netball Victoria and its affiliated associations) may share responsibility — Squadi built and operates the platform, but the sporting bodies collected the data through it.

**Once an organisation becomes aware of a potential breach, a 30-day assessment period begins** under the NDB scheme. This report constitutes notification.

## What Needs to Happen

### Immediately
1. Squadi must **remove the published access key** from their website code
2. Squadi must **restrict access to player personal details** so that only authorised people (coaches, administrators) can see them, and only for their own teams
3. Squadi must **check their system logs** to determine whether anyone has already bulk-downloaded player data

### Within Weeks
4. Squadi must **review all parts of the system** that return personal details and ensure proper access controls are in place
5. The **NDB notification obligations** must be assessed — if the breach meets the serious harm threshold, Squadi and the sporting bodies must notify the OAIC and affected individuals
6. **All access keys must be changed** — the current key has been publicly available (including in internet archives) for over 2 years and must be considered compromised

### Within Months
7. A **full security review** of the platform should be conducted across all sports
8. A **proper access control system** should be implemented that separates public information (ladders, scores, schedules) from private information (player details, contact information)

## Who Needs to Be Informed?

| Organisation | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Squadi / World Sport Action** | They built and operate the platform — they must fix the problem |
| **Netball Victoria** | They are responsible for the data of Victorian netball players collected through this platform |
| **Netball Australia** | The exposure is national — all states and territories are potentially affected |
| **Basketball bodies** | The basketball platform is confirmed to have the same vulnerability |
| **Football Australia / state bodies** | The football/soccer platform is confirmed to have the same vulnerability |
| **OAIC** | The privacy regulator — must be notified if Squadi doesn't act, or if NDB obligations are triggered |

### Suggested Netball Victoria Contacts
- **Penny Forrest** — Child Safety & Integrity Coordinator
- **Rebecca Costanzo** — Head of Integrity and Compliance
- **Rohan Safstrom** — IT Support and Services Manager
- **Ginny Robinson** — Systems Relationship Manager

## About This Report

This report is provided in good faith as a **responsible disclosure**. I discovered this issue by accident while working on an unofficial personal project. I have not extracted any data beyond what was needed to verify the problem, and I have not shared the access key or any player data with anyone.

I verified the vulnerability using my own daughter's registration record, with my consent as her parent.

A **separate technical report** with full details of the specific systems, endpoints, and code involved is available for Squadi's engineering team.

I am willing to assist with any questions about the findings or the remediation process.
